**Time series forecastibility check** – 

**White noise** - Time series is not a white noise , 

Conclusion - then it’s forecastable 





**Decomposition** – 

Contribution of trend and contribution of seasonality is checked, concluded seasonality term is also important for forecasting target variable. 

Conclusion - So, SARIMA would be better than ARIMA algorithm . 



**Partial autocorrelation** – 

Partial autocorrelation plot shows some lag value at significant level, so predicted variable is correlated to past value. 

Conclusion - So, it can be predictable by earlier value. 





**Time series stationarity check by ADF test** – 

ADF test is done to check original time series is stationary or not. If not then differencing is required. 











EDA prospect – 



Total Call volume monthly, Quarterly 

Average Call volume on weekday and weekend month wise – weekend has very less call compared to weekday 

Call volume trend on holiday vs non-holiday





**Conclusion /information retrieved from EDA** – 

Shift optimization - 



The time range when most call is raised to call centre? / what is peak time when maximum call raised? 

The time range in a day for which how much agent should be present ? 

The time range when no call or very less call comes?

When no need of any agent ?
